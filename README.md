# Gameplay Video
Here are two videos of my game, since it may be a hassle to open the files on Unity to play yourself! The mermaid character is drawn to look like my sister, who really likes mermaids. While doing this project, I learned the basics of Unity and C# in just a couple of weeks following this tutorial (https://youtu.be/XtQMytORBmM?si=_lZlsA0M3stDbVBq). The result is this fully hand-drawn (by me) game! 

### Basic Gameplay
A short video of the basic gameplay is below. The shell "coins" are spread randomly so that they appear on average one-third of the time. At the top, there are two scores which count the total shells collected for all times played and the current score, which increases when the mermaid passes through the seaweed.

### Game Over Feature
This game also includes a game over feature, which restarts the game from the beginning, retaining the total coin count but starting the score again from zero. In the future, I would like to add a high score counter as well which shows at the end of a round.
